<p>This is yet another variation on the blog post about hedging ARKK ETF. 
In this post I present a slightly different trading strategy where you're long ARKK during an uptrend and take a short position when the trend turns down (as opposed to going to cash).

				        	Hedging ARKW ETF with ARKK

				    </h1>
<p>This blog post is a slight variation on the previos blog post about hedging ARKK ETF. 
In that post I described a trading strategy when you exit your long position in ARKK whenever the trend turns down. 
In this post I present a slightly different trading strategy where you go long ARKW ETF (Next Generation Internet ETF) and hedge this long position with ARKK whenever the trend turns down. 
This might be interesting for long-term investors who hold a long portfolio of growth stocks and would like to reduce drawdowns. 
In this blog post you can perform your own backtest by choosing the parameters of EMAs and the backtest period.

<p>
Drawdowns reduce total investment returns because it requires a lot of time and  market growth to recover. 
Thereâ€™s a way both to <b>reduce the extent of drawdowns and improve your total returns</b>. 
The answer is using a combination of exponential moving averages to detect when the trend has turned down. 
Identify the periods when the risk of a drawdown is the largest and avoid them by going market neutral. 
On average, <b>hedging significantly reduces drawdowns, and improves investment returns</b>.
